I started process of documenting my thoughts and processes on *Grammarly* but soon I encountered issue of documenting the process for myself and for the presentation which should be separated so I remembered this app could help me with its nested pages and stuff.

TLDR: A personal project with a simple goal: to visualize the 2D world of Claw in 3D space

</aside>

I plan to first of all remaster all of the original 14 levels and find what works and what not in 2.5D

Goals are:

1. Enhanced Graphics and Art Style
2. HD Graphics: Redraw all sprites, backgrounds, and animations in HD to give it a modern look.
3. Dynamic Lighting and Shadows: Add ambient and character lighting to give the environments more depth.
4. Updated Character Models: Keep the original feel but give characters more detail and animations, perhaps with fluid physics-based movements.
5. Parallax Scrolling: Add layers to backgrounds for a sense of depth, making environments feel more dynamic.

**Name of remastered game:**

- **Captain Claw: The Second**
(Could be cool pun since original Claw is universally considered as **too difficult** and **unforgiving**
So I planned to add game mechanic where Claw could rewind time back for a couple of **seconds** to mitigate the difficulty)
- **Captain Claw: Reborn** 
(Sounds cool but Claw never died, also this gives serious vibes while Claw was always chill)

One of the reason behind this project is to provide interesting learning challenge and  also to make something for my CV and my **Artstation.**
I wanted to focus on making beautiful but also interesting and functional game. Possibly addicting

Most notable Challenge: Oblique projection
`*I should take note of the oblique camera script because I am not sure it disables the other camera*`

I got inspired by [Diablo 2: Resurrected](https://youtu.be/4mGYpsHpwN0?si=HriQWK8pA-DSunmf)

"The original Diablo 2 Claw is always running under the hood driving the gameplay
and players can switch back to it to at the press of a button"

I also wanted to make it open source and to be available to everybody all the time but after I found dozen of different abandoned project I figured it would not be the best idea for now

I track my work with the GitHub Project feature
