# Captain Claw Reborn Artstation Blog

I want to draft it out here firstly

I want to make 14 art pieces, for every existing level. Every one of them had different challenges 

but when I made full circle and went back to the first level I made it was nice feeling to see all the workflow improvements I made during the process
