# Unity Challenges

Using HDRP because I have the most experience with it so that it makes sense

Main distribution should be Steam since Discord server had HC fans and most of them play Claw (which means they for sure have a PC)

I wanted to make sure I learn a lot in unity 6, even though editor stayed roughly the same I felt lot of small but noticeable improvements all over the place 

I would be using physics material to achieve dynamic treasures (bouncing)

And I must admit I am impressed by the Unity team how they presented their free tier Unity Cloud Products

1 day of research to get it going and work with the in game stuff

**Player Authentication:** Steam $ and Discord :discord:
I don’t want to bother with Authentication right now but down the line it is good to know there is this simple way to add Leaderboards (with proper authentication) in a matter of hours

**Unity Version Control** offers much better workflow then what I used before 

TurtoiseGit is great, but for game development in unity that comes with bunch of .meta files you get lot of visual noise, 

It made perfect sense to make this in editor thing but I didn’t expected such level of polish. I was able to seamlessly work on my laptop and PC at the same time

**Cloud Build** - Even though this game is simple for now I want to be able to see how it works to build in the cloud in the future 

Unity Cloud Build is a great option if you're working on Unity projects and want an efficient, automated way to handle builds. Here are some benefits:

1. **Automated Builds**: Cloud Build lets you set up automated builds that trigger whenever you push changes to your source control. This can save a lot of time and ensure that you’re always working with up-to-date builds.
2. **Cross-Platform Builds**: You can simultaneously build for multiple platforms (like iOS, Android, WebGL, and PC) without needing separate hardware or operating systems, which is especially helpful if you're targeting multiple platforms.
3. **Save Local Resources**: By handling builds in the cloud, you free up your local resources (CPU, memory) and can continue working without waiting on long builds.
4. **Team Collaboration**: If you’re working with a team, Unity Cloud Build can be very helpful for keeping everyone up-to-date. Each member can access the latest build from any device, making testing and feedback easier.
5. **Error Tracking and Logging**: Unity Cloud Build gives you detailed error logs, which can help you debug and catch build errors early in the development process.
6. **Build Distribution**: With Cloud Build, you can automatically distribute builds to testers or stakeholders by sharing download links, which helps streamline the testing process.

In short, Unity Cloud Build can significantly improve development workflow, especially for teams or developers targeting multiple platforms. It helps automate and streamline building, testing, and distribution.

**Unity Visual Scripting**
Before it was Bolt now its part of the unity, very useful when prototyping
I made many gameplay stuff with it
